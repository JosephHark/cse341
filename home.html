                            <li>Do involve others in your recovery. Continue to talk to someone when
                                needed regarding your emotional & mental health.</li>
                            <li>Do use the activities that work best for you and promote your
                                recovery. This is different for everyone.</li>
                            <li>Do keep busy (do things to help your physical health, participate in
                                service activities, spend time with family or friends)</li>
                            <li>Do take up a wholesome hobby.</li>

                                clean time under their belt.</li>
                            <li>Do not fall into dangerous behaviors or emotions. (I.e. dishonesty,
                                blame, self-pity, resentment etc.)</li>
                            <li>Do not get complacent with your life and recovery. Boredom is
